Q: What are mash-ups?
A: These are routes where you fly with different airlines, because it`s cheaper than booking with just one. For example:

If you wanted to fly London to New York, we might find it`s cheaper to fly out with British Airways and back with Virgin Atlantic, rather than buy a round-trip ticket with one airline. This is called a "sum-of-one-way" mash-up. Just in case you're interested.

Another kind of mash-up is what we call a "self-transfer" or a "non-protected transfer". For example:

If you wanted to fly London to Sydney, we might find it`s cheaper to fly London to Dubai with Emirates, and then Dubai to Sydney with Qantas, rather than booking the whole route with one airline.

Pretty simple, right?

However, what`s really important to bear in mind is that mash-ups are NOT codeshares. A codeshare is when the airlines have an alliance. If anything goes wrong with the route - a delay, say, or a strike - those airlines will help you out at no extra cost. But mash-ups DO NOT involve an airline alliance. So if something goes wrong with a mash-up, it could cost you more money.
